## TTRs

The repository contains scripts and data used to identify and analyze transmembrane transcriptional regulators (TTRs).

**getTTRs.py** - get TTRs from MiST using its API.

**getTTR_tm_regions.py** - get transmembrane region sequences and coordinates.

**getTTR_st_statistics.py** - get TTR and other signal transduction protein counts.

**TTR_TM_surface_area.py** - calculate the length and surface area of transmembrane regions.
